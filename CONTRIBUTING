If you wish to coordinate or help out with this project, I would humbly ask that you meet
me in person at the CU Student Government Office. I will also be reaching out to the larger
CU Community this fall for help in creating tags and adding metadata that this code won't be able
to do without human intervention.

I plan on holding regular office hours from
11:30AM to 1/1:30PM over this summer MWF (2018). These hours may change. Use the people-search
on CU-Boulder's website for contact information.
