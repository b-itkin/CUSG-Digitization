If you contribute to this project in any fashion my 2 fast and hard rules are these:
Don't be an asshole
Respect the documents

On the latter clause, I will not hesitate to halt your participation in this project if for
any reason I see you /intentionally/ endangering or being /grossly negligent/ with the documents 
in any way. 
We all make mistakes, but don't put your coffee on originals, always make backups, and don't intentionally
rip anything. If you have a question on how best to handle something, ask! 

Our primary purposes here are preservation and transparency. Please act knowing this

Finally, and most importantly:
Discrimination of any sort on the basis of the following protected classes is not only legally
prohibited of yourself as an employee, volunteer, or student of the University of Colorado,
but is also a shitty thing to do. By working on this project in any capacity (including but not
limited to coding/submissions of that code to the Historian, scanning of documents etc.), you 
agree to not discriminate on the basis of:
"race,  color,  national  origin,  sex, 
pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation, or political philosophy, 
or  any  other personal  characteristic  not  directly  related  to  the  situation  in 
question." (See Article I Section E of the CU Student Government Constitution.)

-Any complaints about discrimination should be forwarded to myself and the CUSG Office Manager.
-All complaints about any persons involved in this project will be taken seriously. You
should be advised that both I and the CUSG Office Manager are both Mandatory Reporters, and you
may hear from another office at CU if you choose to report to us. However, we can also insure
that the quickest action is taken to prevent any additional harm at the level of this project
and the CUSG office. 

You should be advised that if you are a student you also have the right to contact:
A) The CU Student Government Appellate Court (if you are being discriminated against by an
officer of CUSG, you have the right to file a suit and seek injunctive relief.)
B) The Office of Victims Assistance (They are victims advocates in cases of discrimination and
sexual assault/harrassment)
C) The Ombudsman of the University of Colorado Boulder
